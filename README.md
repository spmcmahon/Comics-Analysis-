# Comics-Analysis-
Examining comic book sales to identify possible film/TV/gaming adaptation opportunities. 


Background: 

Considering that the publisheres Marvel and DC make up a large majority of the comic book market, and with all of their properties being completely controlled by Disney and Warner Brothers, it may seem as if no other company would have a chace to adapt comics to screen or game. 

But this may not be the case.  We will take a look at the relative performance of some of the smaller more independant comic book publishers to see how their titles fare in comparison and get a sense of where we might be able to look for possibilities. 




The question: 

Which titles/collentions might be worth considering for adaptation? Not just based on personal preference, but based on the source material's success in the comic book market.

Comichron is site maintained by comic-book author John Jackson Miller which compiles and maintains data of comic book sales. 

Diamond Distributors served as the primary distributor of all physical comic books in North America for several decades.  They have been releasing monthly and yearly reports of the top comic and graphic novel sales for several years which are all available as spreadsheets on Comichron.com 

I examined the top 1000 graphic novel sales for the years 2009 - 2019 to take get a better look at the relative performance of several publishing houses and their titles.
